📌 Project Overview/n
This project is a terminal-based Banking System implemented in C++ using fundamental data structures like Linked Lists and Hash Tables, and inspired by the concept of Blockchains for enhanced transaction security and integrity.

It simulates a secure and transparent banking application where all transactions are stored immutably using a simplified blockchain mechanism. The system supports basic banking operations like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history with a tamper-evident ledger.



🛠️ Features
🔐 Account creation with unique hashed IDs

💰 Deposit and withdrawal functionality

📜 Transaction history with timestamp

🔗 Blockchain-inspired chaining of transactions

🧠 Uses Linked Lists to manage transaction records

🧾 Hash Table-based hashing of user data for quick access and uniqueness

🛡️ SHA-256 style hashing for block creation

📉 Data integrity check using previous hashes



💻 Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / g++

Concepts: Data Structures (Linked Lists, Hash Tables), Blockchain, Hashing

Hashing Algorithm: Custom djb2 for hash table indexing, and SHA-inspired string hashing
